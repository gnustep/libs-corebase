1 Introduction
================

If you are installing this package as part of the GNUstep core packages,
read the file GNUstep-HOWTO for more complete instructions on how to
install the entire GNUstep package (including this library).
GNUstep-HOWTO is located in the gnustep-make package or at
`http://www.gnustep.org'

   This version of gnustep-base requires:
   
   * gnustep-make version 2.0.0 or higher
   
   * gnustep-base

   * ICU version 4.0 or higher

If you are installing the GNUstep libraries individually, make sure
you already have the GNUstep Makefile package (gnustep-make) installed,
and you have sourced the makefile script:
   . $GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh

Quick installation instructions:

   ./configure
   make
   make install

2 Configuration
=================

Configuration is performed by running the `configure' program at a
shell prompt. You may want to use some of the optional arguments to the
`configure' program. Type `configure --help' for a list of these. It is
not likely that you will need to use the `--prefix' option, since
gnustep-corebase will automatically install in the directory specified by
the `GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_LIBRARY' environment variable (specified when you
installed gnustep-make).

2.1 ICU Library
-----------------

GNUstep's corebase library requires the International Components for
Unicode (www.icu-project.org) library.  ICU provides GNUstep-corebase the
ability to, among other things:
   * Convert to and/or from Unicode
   * Locale specific string comparison
   * Locale specific number and date formatting
   * Time calculations

3 Compilation
===============

To compile this library, type 'make'. After this is complete, type 'make
install' (you must be the root user). Some additional options you
can use with make are `debug=yes' to make a debugging version of the
library and `shared=no' to make a static version of the library. See
the gnustep-make package for more information on these options.
